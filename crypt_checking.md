Let's find out if our array `crypt_of_civilization` contains some items!

Write Ruby code to answer the following questions:
* Does the array contain "container of beer"?
* Does the array contain "Toast-O-Lator"?
* Does the array contain "plastic bird"?

{% show_solution %}
```ruby
crypt_of_civilization.include?("container of beer")
crypt_of_civilization.include?("Toast-O-Lator")
crypt_of_civilization.include?("plastic bird")
```
{% endshow_solution %}
